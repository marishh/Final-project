There are two major branches of optics, physical and geometrical. Physical optics deals primarily with the nature and properties of light itself. Geometrical optics has to do with the principles that govern the image-forming properties of lenses, mirrors, and other devices that make use of light. It also includes optical data processing, which involves the manipulation of the information content of an image formed by coherent optical systems.</article>

                    <p class="paragraphs s20 light">First demonstrated over 20 years ago, optical tweezers have become an established tool in research fields ranging from biophysics to cell biology. As their name suggests, optical tweezers use beams of light to hold and manipulate microscopically small objects such as biological molecules or even living cells. They are formed when a laser beam is tightly focussed to a tiny region in space using a microscope objective as a lens. This region becomes an optical trap that can hold small objects in 3D. </p>
                    <p class="paragraphs s20 light">Optical tweezers can also make accurate measurements of the tiny, sub-picoNewton forces exerted on the trapped objects. This allows researchers to study the diffusion dynamics (or Brownian motion) of an object in a solvent — a property that can play a key role in the function of many biological molecules. Optical tweezers can also be used to micromanipulate an object using well-controlled forces.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="content-1"><p class="paragraphs s20 light">The trapping force that holds an object in place in optical tweezers can be understood by considering how the object refracts light. Because it is tightly focused, the laser light is most intense at the centre of the trap, which means that if the object moves slightly away from the centre in a transverse direction, one part of the object will refract less light than the other. As a result, the object refracts more light away from the centre of the trap than towards it. Light carries momentum and the net effect of this refraction is a force that deflects some of this momentum away from the centre of the trap. By Newton’s third law an equal and opposite force must act on the object, pushing it towards the centre of the trap</p>  
                        <p class="paragraphs s20 light">A similar refraction-related effect also causes the object to push back in the opposite direction of the laser beam (see figure 1b). The trapping is stable only if the force of the laser light scattering from the particle along the positive z–direction is compensated by a trapping force along the negative z-direction. To achieve this, a very tight focus is needed, with a significant fraction of the incident light coming in from large angles. This can be achieved using a lens with high numerical aperture.</p> 
                        <p class="paragraphs s20 light">Force-sensing optical tweezers have the additional ability to track the motion of an object within the trap — information that can then be used to calculate any external forces acting on the object. External forces — notably the Brownian forces caused by an object being continuously bombarded by solvent molecules — tend to displace the object from the centre of the trap. Using interferometry measurements of the light refracted from the object, this displacement can be determined to nanometre accuracy, which allows the external forces to be measured at the sub-picoNewton level.</p>

                    <p class="paragraphs s20 light">Light moves with speed c in a vacuum. But light can move with a speed less than c, when it passes through some material. The table shows the speed of light when it goes through glass, water, and air. Note that in this table the speed of light in each material is given as a decimal times the speed of light in a vacuum.</p>
                    <p class="paragraphs s20 light">In certain exotic materials light can move much slower than c, and in some cases can even be brought entirely to a halt. Light has been slowed to one mile per hour (.0000000015c) in an unusual form of matter known as a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC). And in 2001, physicists for the first time managed to stop light in a vapor of rubidium gas.</p>
