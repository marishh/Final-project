The table shows the speed of light when it goes through glass, water, and air.

And in 2001, physicists for the first time managed to stop light in a vapor of rubidium gas.</p>

                        <p class="paragraphs s20 light">The concept of quantization led during the 1920s to the development of quantum mechanics, which appeared to provide physicists with the correct method of calculating the structure of the atom. In his model Niels Bohr had postulated that the electrons in the atom move only in orbits in which the angular momentum (angular velocity multiplied by mass) has certain fixed values. Each of these allowed values is characterized by a quantum number that can have only integer values. </p>
                        <p class="paragraphs s20 light">In the full quantum mechanical treatment of the structure of the atom, developed in the 1920s, three quantum numbers relating to angular momentum arise because there are three independent variable parameters in the equation describing the motion of atomic electrons.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphs s20 light">In 1925, however, two Dutch physicists, Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck, realized that, in order to explain fully the spectra of light emitted by the atoms of alkali metals, such as sodium, which have one outer valence electron beyond the main core, there must be a fourth quantum number that can take only two values, −1/2 and +1/2.</p>

                        <p class="paragraphs s20 light">Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck proposed that this quantum number refers to an internal angular momentum, or spin, that the electrons possess. This implies that the electrons, in effect, behave like spinning electric charges. Each therefore creates a magnetic field and has its own magnetic moment. The internal magnet of an atomic electron orients itself in one of two directions with respect to the magnetic field created by the rest of the atom. It is either parallel or antiparallel; hence, there are two quantized states—and two possible values of the associated spin quantum number.</p>  
                        <p class="paragraphs s20 light">The concept of spin is now recognized as an intrinsic property of all subatomic particles. Indeed, spin is one of the key criteria used to classify particles into two main groups: fermions, with half-integer values of spin (1/2, 3/2,…), and bosons, with integer values of spin (0, 1, 2,…). In the Standard Model all of the “matter” particles (quarks and leptons) are fermions, whereas “force” particles such as photons are bosons. These two classes of particles have different symmetry properties that affect their behaviour.</p>

                        <p class="paragraphs s20 light">First demonstrated over 20 years ago, optical tweezers have become an established tool in research fields ranging from biophysics to cell biology. As their name suggests, optical tweezers use beams of light to hold and manipulate microscopically small objects such as biological molecules or even living cells. They are formed when a laser beam is tightly focussed to a tiny region in space using a microscope objective as a lens. This region becomes an optical trap that can hold small objects in 3D. </p>
                        <p class="paragraphs s20 light">Optical tweezers can also make accurate measurements of the tiny, sub-picoNewton forces exerted on the trapped objects. This allows researchers to study the diffusion dynamics (or Brownian motion) of an object in a solvent — a property that can play a key role in the function of many biological molecules. Optical tweezers can also be used to micromanipulate an object using well-controlled forces.</p>

                            <div class="content-1"><p class="paragraphs s20 light">The trapping force that holds an object in place in optical tweezers can be understood by considering how the object refracts light. Because it is tightly focused, the laser light is most intense at the centre of the trap, which means that if the object moves slightly away from the centre in a transverse direction, one part of the object will refract less light than the other. As a result, the object refracts more light away from the centre of the trap than towards it. Light carries momentum and the net effect of this refraction is a force that deflects some of this momentum away from the centre of the trap. By Newton’s third law an equal and opposite force must act on the object, pushing it towards the centre of the trap</p>  
                            <p class="paragraphs s20 light">A similar refraction-related effect also causes the object to push back in the opposite direction of the laser beam (see figure 1b). The trapping is stable only if the force of the laser light scattering from the particle along the positive z–direction is compensated by a trapping force along the negative z-direction. To achieve this, a very tight focus is needed, with a significant fraction of the incident light coming in from large angles. This can be achieved using a lens with high numerical aperture.</p> 
                            <p class="paragraphs s20 light">Force-sensing optical tweezers have the additional ability to track the motion of an object within the trap — information that can then be used to calculate any external forces acting on the object. External forces — notably the Brownian forces caused by an object being continuously bombarded by solvent molecules — tend to displace the object from the centre of the trap. Using interferometry measurements of the light refracted from the object, this displacement can be determined to nanometre accuracy, which allows the external forces to be measured at the sub-picoNewton level.</p>
