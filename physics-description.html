            <article class="article-1 blackc regular s28">Physics, science that deals with the structure of matter and the interactions between the fundamental constituents of the observable universe. In the broadest sense, physics (from the Greek physikos) is concerned with all aspects of nature on both the macroscopic and submicroscopic levels. Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of objects under the action of given forces but also the nature and origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force fields. Its ultimate objective is the formulation of a few comprehensive principles that bring together and explain all such disparate phenomena.</article>

                    <p class="paragraphs s20 light">In 2012, particles smashed together in the Large Hadron Collider’s 27-kilometer circular tunnel conjured up the Higgs boson — the last missing particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics, and the linchpin that holds that decades-old set of equations together.</p>
                    <p class="paragraphs s20 light">But no other new particles have materialized at the LHC, leaving open many mysteries about the universe that the Standard Model doesn’t address. A debate has ensued over whether to build an even more enormous successor to the LHC — a proposed machine 100 kilometers in circumference, possibly in Switzerland or China — to continue the search for new physics.</p>
                    <p class="paragraphs s20 light">Physicists say there’s much we can still learn from the Higgs boson itself. What’s known is that the particle’s existence confirms a 55-year-old theory about the origin of mass in the universe.</p>

                    <p class="paragraphs s20 light">Light moves with speed c in a vacuum. But light can move with a speed less than c, when it passes through some material. The table shows the speed of light when it goes through glass, water, and air. Note that in this table the speed of light in each material is given as a decimal times the speed of light in a vacuum.</p>
                    <p class="paragraphs s20 light">In certain exotic materials light can move much slower than c, and in some cases can even be brought entirely to a halt. Light has been slowed to one mile per hour (.0000000015c) in an unusual form of matter known as a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC). And in 2001, physicists for the first time managed to stop light in a vapor of rubidium gas.</p>
